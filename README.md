## Tech/framework used
Built with VSCode

## Features
This is an interactive game built with HTML, CSS, and JS. The user works on finding the hidden objects before the end of the five minutes countdown timer.

## How to use
First, the user needs to set their browser's zoom to 33% to enjoy the game. On the Welcome Page, the user has to enter their name and press enter. Upon pressing enter, the user will be taken to the Game Page to start playing the game. The user will need to look at the objects on the right hand of the screen and work on finding them inside the image by clicking on the hidden objects. When an object is found and clicked on, the corresponding object on the right side of the screen will be crossed out. If the user is not successful with finding the hidden object before the countdown timer hits 0:00, a message will display with an option to exit the game or play again. If the user finds the ten objects before the end of the countdown timer, a message will display with an option to exit the game or play it again.

## Unresolved Issues & Future Improvements
